This is the same language that is peddled by "race realists" ... You
make an identity out of the fact that people disagree with you.  This
is what is known as the "bitch-baby cancel culture snowflake move",
where you push some bad research, and you then make a career out of
milking the victimization points that you got out of people
criticizing you for your bad research.

We never should have let the narrative of "cancel culture" end up
growing to the size that it has.  Holy fucking shit.  Now every
single person with a bad idea goes online, gets criticized for it,
and makes a fucking career out of the fact that they had a bad idea.

Imagine being the president of the United States, and saying "we will
no longer stand victim to cancel culture".  You're the fucking
president, bro!  There is no one less cancelled than you.  You could
drone strike my house!  You are so not cancelled.  Cancelling doesn't
mean getting criticized.
