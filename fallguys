Uncountable aeons ago, Lucifer, the morning star, rebelled against
God.  And for his crimes, he was cast down to hell. He was the first
"Fall Guy".  And I am the second.

I don't think you have to pass to be attractive.  I think most people
would agree with that.  One thing that's really unfortunate is: to a
lot of people, the idea of passing for a trans person and being
attractive as a trans person are completely synonymous.  Whereas
there are some people who don't pass especially well, who I still
think are super duper fucking attractive.  To suggest that passing
and attractiveness are the same thing and they overlap completely in
every way is to suggest that attractiveness can only exist within the
binary.

Can I sell my pansexuality?  If you mean "people can get social clout
for their sexual orientation", then congratulations, welcome to being
heterosexual for pretty much all of american history.

> Did Regular Show do romance well?
I've only seen a few episodes of Regular Show.  Not my type of humor.
Too "lol xD random" for me.  It just feels like "lol xD random" but
self aware, so people who normally would cringe at lol xD random
shit got into it, and they're like "hahaa it's not like other lol xD
random shit", but it is.  It is exactly like other lol xD random shit.

I love highena, she actually can't shoot explosions out of her
forehead, which is really disappointing sometimes when I think about
it.  But, y'know, we all have to settle.

Here's my fuckin' hot take, are you ready for it guys? Any and all
light novel adaptation anime are garbage, and anything that looks
like this is garbage.
