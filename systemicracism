We don't live in a meritocracy.  Unless we do something about it,
black people will ALWAYS be significantly poorer than white people.
We could keep america running for a thousand years from this point
forward with no changes whatsoever, and this would continue into
perpetuity.

This is one of the great big tricks laid out by the capital owners,
by the wealthy businessmen.  and by the media moguls and by the
politicians they buy.  One of the big things they disseminate, this
lie, is that the economy is a zero-sum game.  "Anything they get, you
don't get.  Anything they get, they're taking from you!  Reparations
for the black community?  That's money being taken from white america
to black america.  You lose it."  And that division, that myth, that
narrative that is sold to you, is one which encourages people in this
country to remain complacent in the face of their exploitation.

We have to recognize that black people face barriers that just
low-income families in general necessarily do not.  Whether it comes
to the likelihood of getting a job, the relationship you might have
with the police, the systemic likelihood of you being incarcerated,
whether it comes to the treatment you receive from the people around
you; these are factors which will press down on an already
substantial wealth gap.

Nigerian Africans are incredibly wealthy in this country on average.
The reason for that is because you have a selection bias.  Only the
wealthiest people from those countries can afford to come here to the
US. ... You'll see biases like that with regards to a lot of
immigrant communities, with some exceptions, one of which being the
mexican community, because the barrier between the United States and
Mexico is not one which has been historically described by "high
skilled professionals" coming over.  Same with Chinese students as
well.  People say "the Chinese are so wealthy, are so hard working."
No!  The reason the Chinese in this country are so wealthy on average
is because wealthy Chinese families send their rich, preppy fucking
sons and daughters over here to get good american education and to
learn English.

Being poor is a magnifier for other issues.  I'll give you another
example.  Being super-duper wealthy and being trans makes being trans
a lot easier than being super-duper poor and trans.  Disability?
Holy shit!  Being super wealthy and losing an arm or a leg?  You can
just buy a replacement; you can literally buy a replacement for that
shit, if you have the money!  If you're poor, a disability can be
life ruining.  If you're wealthy and you have a sickness, you can
afford the best medical care in the world.  America HAS the best
medical care in the world... if you're wealthy.  But if you're poor,
you can die!
