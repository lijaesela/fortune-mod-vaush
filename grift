Being an alt-righter is like being a professional vuvuzela player, or
a magician.  99% of the time, you're only going to cause misery to
yourself and those around you, and the only time you're not is when
you get so good at it -- or so lucky -- that you get to teach those
crafts to another generation of miserable shit eaters.  So remember,
you're doing it for them, ok?  You're doing it for them.
